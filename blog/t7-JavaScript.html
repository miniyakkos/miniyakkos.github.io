      After learning Ruby the past few weeks and learning JavaScript this week, I noticed there were many similarities as well as differences between the 2 languages. One thing I noticed is that I think looping in JS is a lot easier than in Ruby. This is because JS includes a counter when you write a loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The syntax when writing a loop in JS is
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      for(i=0; i<5; i++) {}
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, the i represents the counter, initialized with the value 0. The second is the "test", checking to run the loop when i is less than 5. The i++ is telling to increase the counter by 1 every time it runs the loop. Writing a while loop is similar by initializing a counter and then running the loop only when a test returns true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The syntax when writing a loop in Ruby is a little different. A for loop is generally used when you know how many times you want to run the loop. The syntax in Ruby is
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      5.times do...end
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a for loop but it can only be used on an iterable object, such as an array.
