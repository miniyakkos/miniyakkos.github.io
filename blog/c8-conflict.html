      Personally, I hate conflicts. I tend to avoid them at all costs, but some conflicts are unavoidable. One conflict I had recently was with my now ex boyfriend. When we were still together, it was hard for us to find time to spend together because we both worked full time jobs. I worked Monday through Friday while he usually worked on the weekends. Towards the end of our relationship, I got accepted into DBC and started my phase 0 work. My free time became even more scarce. When I went over to his apartment, he would usually stay on his computer and continue to play games for an hour or two. I didn't mind it at first, before I started phase 0. I would usually keep myself occupied and wait for him to finish playing. However, after I started phase 0, I became annoyed by his behavior.

      I realized the source of this conflict was because I felt like he was wasting my time, when my free time has become scarce. Upon realizing the conflict, I felt disrespected. I spoke with him about this conflict, but he continued his behavior. Eventually this conflict, among others, became the reason why we ended our relationship. If I could go back, I don't think I would do anything differently. From this experience, I learned that wasting other people's time is disrespectful.
