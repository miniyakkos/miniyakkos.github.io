      When I first started looking into DBC, I learned that DBC teaches Ruby on Rails. As a person with no prior programming background, I didn't understand what that was. In fact, I'm on week 8 of phase 0 and I still don't really understand what it is, so I decided to research about it this week.

      According to Wikipedia, Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework. Open source means that anybody can use it freely. A web application framework is a software framework to support the development of websites and web applications. They provide libraries for database access, templating framework and session management. Ruby on Rails uses the model-view-controller pattern to organize application programming. MVC is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.

      As you can guess from the name, Rails is written in Ruby. Other frameworks include Pylons (Python), Django (Python), AngularJS (JavaScript), and Backbone.js (JavaScript). Some of the well known websites running Ruby on Rails include GitHub, Hulu, and formerly Twitter.
