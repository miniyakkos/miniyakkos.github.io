    <p>The difference between margin, border, and padding is actually very simple. Here is an image to help visualize the difference:
    </p>
    <img src="/week2.png" alt="Margin, Border, and Padding">
    <p>In this image, the red box represents the content, the black line is the border, and the padding is the white space between the black line and the red box. The Margin is outside of the border, and represents the space between the object next to it.
    </p>
    <p>When using CSS to style webpages, it helps to understand the difference between the margin, border, and the padding. Margins would help space out different objects, and the padding helps puts space between the border and the content. Here's the navigation bar from my webpage. I have it set so that it's only as wide as its text inside and space between them at 10 pixels on both the left and right sides.</p>
    <img src="/example1.png" alt="Nav bar with margin">
    <p>If I take out the margins, the spaces between the texts are gone.</p>
    <img src="/example2.png" alt="Nav bar no margin">
    <p>Here's a sidebar, still in construction. The border is the white line around it. I have the padding set at 10px.
    </p>
    <img src="/exmple3.png" alt="Sidebar with padding">
    <p>If I take out the padding, the line is right on the edge of the content.</p>
    <p>As shown with the examples above, being able to manipulate the margin, border, and padding is important when trying to work on the visuals of a website.
