      Ruby is an object-oriented language and supports different kinds of variables. They are global variables, class variables, instance variables, and local variables. In this post I will describe the scope of these variables and describe when to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First are the global variables. They are usually marked by $ before the variable name or by all capital letters. They are accessible anywhere in a program. Something similar to a global variable is a constant, where you can set a certain value and your program will warn you if you try to change it. Although global variables may be tempting to use because they are accessible anywhere, their use should be minimal. They can be read and written by any method, which may break another part of the program.

      Second are the class variables. They are marked by @@ before the variable name. They are accessible to all instances of that particular class. They are specific to a certain class, so other classes do not have access to them. They can be used when you want to keep data about a particular class, like how many instances of the class has been created.
    </p>

      Third are the instance variables. Instance variables are marked by @ before the variable name. They are accessible to a single instance of a class. This is the variable to use if you want a variable accessible to all methods within a class, but doesn't affect other instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last are the local variables. They are not marked by any special characters before the name. They are accessible only within the block of code they are called. If they are called in a method within a class, they are accessible only within that method. They are useful because their name can be reused in another method, because they are different variables.
