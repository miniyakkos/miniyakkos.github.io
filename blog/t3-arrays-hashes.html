      Arrays and Hashes are similar, yet they are different. It is important to know the difference in order to utilize them effectively. An array is a collection of objects, while a hash is a collection of key-value pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think an array is like an ordered list. In a sense, an array is like a hash, where the key is the number on the list. You can look up what is on the list by the number. An important note though is that programmers count from 0 so the first object of an array is actually the 0th object. An array can contain any object, including another array. Thus, it is possible to have an array of an array, or multi-dimensional arrays.

    <p>
      Here is an example of an array of strings:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      letter_array["A", "B", "C"]<br>
      letter_array[1] will retrieve the second string, "B".
    </p>
    <p>
      If an array is an ordered list, then I like to think a hash is like a phonebook. The key would be the name of a person and the value would be their phone number. You get the value (the phone number) by looking up the key (their name).
