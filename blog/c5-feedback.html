      I think peer pairing is a great way to solve challenges. Coding can often times be stressful and frustrating when the code is not doing what you want it to do. Having another person's input helps with learning new skills and tricks. I always find it rewarding to see a different approach to solving the same problem by having another person explain how they came up with a solution.

      However, there are times when peer pairing can be difficult. So far, I've found peer pairing to be a bit more difficult when my peer's technical knowledge is way lower or way higher than mine. Working with a peer who doesn't have as much technical knowledge takes patience, but it allows me to make sure my thought process can be understood clearly. On the other hand, I've found myself intimidated by people who are technically advanced. I usually use these opportunities to learn as much as I can, but I feel intimidated because I feel like I'm behind on the material.

      Most of the feedback I've received has been positive. I have had a few bumpy pairing sessions, at least in my opinion, but all of the feedback has been kind. The feedback is useful because they point out where I can improve. Based on the feedback, I think I should look at the material before a pairing session. I should also remember to switch off roles, because there were a few times where I forgot. Writing feedback has generally been easy for me, but I've had a few difficulties writing actionable feedback because my pair was so good.
