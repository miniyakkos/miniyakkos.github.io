      I think generally I try to ask good questions. I try to be specific as possible so that the person I'm asking knows what I'm talking about. Way back in the first week, I had a question when I was installing SQLite. I had no idea what the error message was saying so I took a screenshot and included it with my question. I included details such as how I was getting the message. In the end, the error resolved itself but I did get helpful responses to my question.

      Another important note about asking a good question is the audience you're asking to. When I had a coding question, I didn't ask my boss at work who knows nothing about coding. When asking a coding question on Google, it's important to include what language you're working with. A solution for Ruby isn't what you want when you're working with JavaScript.
