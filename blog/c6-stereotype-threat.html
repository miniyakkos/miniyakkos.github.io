      Stereotype threat is topic in social psychology that has been originally studied by Calude Steele. It is a situation where people feel threatened that they will be confirming a negative stereotype about a certain group. This threat manifests itself as a self-induced handicap, and can hinder their ability to perform.

      Personally, I have never been aware of stereotype threat. However, in retrospect, I may have been affected by it during my high school and college years. I attended a Catholic high school and college as a non-Catholic person. We were required to take Theology classes, and they were usually my lowest grades. I may have subconsciously handicapped myself from achieving good grades because I thought non-Catholic people wouldn't know more about the Catholic faith than a Catholic person.

      I think the best way to talk yourself out of a stereotype threat is to strive to be the exception to the rule. It is hard to get rid of stereotypes, so instead, you can think of yourself as the exception. I think this is a good way to turn something negative into something positive. If you think "I will be the one that is going to prove this stereotype wrong" then it will motivate you to do better. It is similar to seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty. It comes down to your mindset.
