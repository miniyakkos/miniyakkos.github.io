      There are many benefits of version control. It works like a save point in a video game. You can create multiple saves, and if you mess up, you don't have to start all the way from the beginning. They track and save changes so you can go back to an earlier version. Because it tracks changes, you can also pinpoint where you made a mistake and work from there.

        Git tracks changes by committing changes. You can check if you have made any changes by checking git status. It will show any changes made, or any changes ready to be committed. You then have to stage, which gets it ready to commit. You can unstage if it's not ready to be committed. You then commit the staged changes with a commit message.

        Using GitHub to store code is beneficial because it acts as an online place to store your code. It makes it easier to work on the same project with other people, because you can download a copy of the code, work on it, and then upload it. You don't have to worry about overwriting other people's work, and other people can review your code before it is implemented. It also allows you to work from anywhere with an internet access.
