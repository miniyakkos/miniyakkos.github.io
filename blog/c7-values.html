      When I think of the times in my life where I was the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied, the following values come to mind: accomplishment, close relationships, creativity, excitement, freedom, helping others, honesty, knowledge, inspiration, and personal development. In general, I try my best to live up to these values.

      Out of all of the above values, the one that is most important to me is personal development. This value is important because it encourages me to work on all of the values. I ask myself "How can I be a better person?" all the time. The answer depends on the day, but it encourages personal development in some way. It also helps create a positive mindset when facing difficulties or problems in life. One of my good friends used to joke and say "it builds character" whenever she had to do something difficult. I thought it was funny at the time, but I realized that it is actually true. It is a matter of taking on challenges with a positive mindset, to think of everything as a learning experience.

      Recently, one of my coworkers found out that I would be leaving the company to attend DBC. He asked me how I could quit a stable job, move to a different city, and without a guarantee of a new job. I told him it was because I had faith in myself, and that things would eventually work out. And even if things didn't work out, it would be a good learning experience. Again, my advice came down to my most important value of personal development.

      In last week's cultural blog, I touched on the topic of stereotype threat. I think values can help with mediating stereotype threat. Having values helps with having a positive mindset. For example, I'm a female, and that supposedly puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to coding. However, instead of worrying that I might not be a good programmer because I'm a female, I focus on how much I've learned so far. 2 months ago I didn't even know how to create and edit an HTML file. Now I'm here typing this blog post in an HTML file, and I even styled the page using CSS. By focusing on personal development, I think I've helped fight stereotype threat (even if I was not aware of experiencing it in the first place).
