      The first thing that comes to my mind when someone says "problems in the tech industry" is the lack of diversity of its workforce. The stereotype is that workers in the tech industry are white males, because they are the majority. The minority in the tech workforce are considered female, African-American, and/or Hispanic.

      So why the lack of diversity? I think there are a few factors that are contributing to this problem, but the most important one has to do with getting a Computer Science degree in college. Most tech jobs require at least a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My roommate in college was a CS major, and she said that 99% of her classmates were men. She said she used to get intimidated, and she ended up switching her major. I also know another person who is a current grad student pursuing a master's degree in tech, who is the only female in her class. A statistic I found online says only 18% of Computer Science degrees are awarded to females. It also says African-Americans and Hispanics make up less than 10% of college graduates in the United States, of which less than 10% are Computer Science majors.

      Another factor may be a cultural factor. There are certain stereotypes against females, that they have weaker mental abilities when it comes to logic and math. This leads to a culture where females are seen as inferior when it comes to programming, which uses a lot of logic and math. In a broader sense, anything "tech-y" is seen as masculine. In fact, when I was growing up, my parents discouraged me from playing video games "because I was a girl and girls don't play video games." They insisted I should be more interested in "girly stuff" like fashion and make-up (I continued playing video games anyway).

      I think there are some solutions to this problem, which are already beginning to take place. Females are being encouraged to study STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) early on. I went to an all-girls school and they started building up STEM classes right around my senior year of high school. They started offering engineering classes as well as basic computer science classes. I vaguely remember an engineering team visiting our school and promoting studying engineering.

      Another solution is a program like DevBootcamp. These coding bootcamps offer an alternative to a college degree by emphasizing on practical skills rather than knowledge. They are much cheaper than a college degree (My DBC tuition was $11,700, compared to my college tuition of roughly $30,000 a year for 4 years) and also much quicker. This makes tech jobs more accessible to individuals who are unable to attend college.
