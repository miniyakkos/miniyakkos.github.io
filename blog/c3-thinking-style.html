      If I remember correctly, my thinking style was a combination of Abstract Sequential (AS) and Concrete Random (CR). I think I can relate to most of the characteristics of an AS thinker. For example, it is very true that I like to analyze situations before making a decision or acting, and applying logic in solving problems. Some of them don't really apply to me, such as disliking to be forced to work with others with different views, being diplomatic when convincing others, and not monopolizing a conversation.

      I can also relate a lot to the characteristic of a CR thinker. I like experimenting to find answers, using my intuition, and solving problems independently. Surprisingly, all except one apply to me. I don't think I learn best when I am able to compete with others.

      The biggest struggle in phase 0 so far has been time management. As an AS thinker, it is hard for me when I have too little time to think through problems. I have a full time job so my time to work on Phase 0 materials have been restricted to mostly on the weekends. I always feel I am rushing on Sunday night to finish on time. I will need to work on time management to try and work on phase 0 materials throughout the week. It might help to look at coding challenges that need to be completed that week and think of a solution while I'm commuting (or in office meetings!)
