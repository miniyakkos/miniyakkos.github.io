      I think watching this video confirmed that I made the right decision in choosing to attend DBC. My impression of DBC is that it's a place where it's not just about teaching you how to code. It's about teaching how to think like a developer. They teach you the culture, how to work together with other developers, and many other valuable skills. I can't wait to learn about this culture and be immersed in it.

        I'm excited to be in this kind of learning environment. However, I think the video hit spot on about my insecurities about being completely new to programming. Everything Shereef said applies to me, that I'm afraid I would be the slowest learner and I would be dragging my cohort down. I will need to remember that it will be a great learning experience to work with people with very different backgrounds, and that I will be valuable to others as well.
