    <p class ="pairprogramming" id="first">What is pair programming? <br/><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/pair-programming.jpg?w=400"/><br/>
      Pair programming is a collaborative coding environment where multiple people work together on the same device. They work at the same time. There are usually different roles for each person.

    <p class ="pairprogramming" id="second">Why is pair programming important to DBC?<br/><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8Pmv5sCUAAEEm0.jpg"/><br/>
        Pair programming is important to DBC for several reasons. It teaches a few crucial lessons: how to work with another person, how to give and receive feedback, and how to prepare for job interviews. It is a social coding environment that allows for two people to combine their brain power to work on a particular project.

      The driver is the one who is physically behind the keyboard doing the actual typing of the code. They should only look at the code the navigator directs him/her to. The Navigator tells the driver what to type but also asks for input from
      the driver. Both can act as "co-navigators" and collaborate while navigating even though one person is driving.
